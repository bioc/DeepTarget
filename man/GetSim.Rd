\title{
Compute a correlation between the every gene crispr KO vs each drug response.
}
\description{
Computes correlations between the viability of cell lines after CRISPR knockout of each gene and the viability of the same cell lines after drug treatment.

\usage{
GetSim(drugName =DrugName, DRS= drugResponseScore,GES= GeneEffectScores)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.

Description: This package predicts a drugâ€™s primary target(s) or secondary target(s) by integrating large-scale genetic and drug screens from the Cancer Dependency Map project run by the Broad Institute. It further investigates whether the drug specifically targets the wild-type or mutated target forms. To show how to use this package in practice, we provided sample data along with step-by-step example.

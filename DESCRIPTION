Description: This package predicts a drugâ€™s primary target(s) or secondary target(s) by integrating large-scale genetic and drug screens from the Cancer Dependency Map project run by the Broad Institute. It further investigates whether the drug specifically targets the wild-type or mutated target forms. To show how to use this package in practice, we provided sample data along with step-by-step example. We also guided how to interpret the result.
The user of this package is required to agree to the terms and conditions of DepMap portal (https://depmap.org/portal/).  Some of these terms and conditions are problematic for U.S. Federal Government employees, and they should consult their technology transfer office/legal office before agreeing to such terms and conditions.

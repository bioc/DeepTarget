#Custom Error handling: The err_handle() function is a simple function that tries to evaluate an expression x,
# and if an error occurs it returns NA instead. This is known as error handling,
#and it allows the code to continue running even if an error is encountered.
errHandle<-function(x){ tryCatch(x, error=function(e){NA}) }
